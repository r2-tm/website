                    <h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
                    <p>Football-like games have been played since ancient times. 
                        In ancient China, a game called "cuju" was played, which 
                        involved kicking a leather ball through a small opening in 
                        a net.</p>

                    <h3>Medieval Europe</h3>
                    <p>During the medieval period, various forms of football were
                         played across Europe. These games were often chaotic and 
                         had few rules. They were more about team rivalry and less 
                         about organized competition.</p>

                    <h3>Modern Era</h3>
                    <p>The modern version of football began to take shape in the 
                        19th century in England. The establishment of standardized 
                        rules and the formation of football clubs led to the sport's 
                        rapid growth and global popularity.</p>
